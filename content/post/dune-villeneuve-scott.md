# Dune is hauntingly familiar
<!--more-->
Denis Villeneuve's career has a lot of similarities to Ridley Scott's. Where Ridley Scott may be best known for his original sci-fi movie Alien, his adaptation-amalgam Blade Runner and his period piece Gladiator, he often directed grounded military and political thrillers like Black Hawk Down and Body of Lies.

Like a mirror image Denis Villeneuve started his career in earnest with Incendies, Prisoners and Sicario. Grounded, brutal and difficult thrillers, which tonally aren't unlike Scott's later thrillers Hannibal, Body of Lies and The Counselor.

The comparison between the two directors becomes more understandable with Blade Runner 2049, a direct and faithful, but still original and surprising sequel to Scott's own movie.

In this dichotomy Dune (part I) shouldn't be considered a sci-fi movie first, but is more akin to Gladiator or Kingdom of Heaven: a political costume drama with a gritty action core - which just so happens to be set in space. And just like Villeneuve seems to haunt Scott's work, Frank Herbert's Dune haunts all of modern sci-fi: An evil empire, an invisible force, sand crawler, many-teethed monsters, disfigured enemies and two celestial bodies over a desert planet sound like the blue-print for the setting of the first Star Wars movie. The heavy borrowing of Arabic and North-African culture, architecture and history combined with deformed elite warriors can be traced from Dune in a straight line to The Chronicles of Riddick. Firefly, the Warhammer 40.000 universe and many, many more, bear resemblance to a lot of aspects of Dune.

Denis Villeneuve came to do the relevance of Dune justice, just like he did justice to Blade Runner and eclipsed the original, with his more coherent and much more lively vision for 2049. Where Black Hawk Down is one-dimensional jingoism, Villeneuve's Incendies is a grounded examination of middle-eastern conflict. Where The Counselor is all over the place, when trying to depict why and how the war on drugs is failing, Sicario is more concise and much better executed. Where Hannibal is a rather shallow and gimmicky representation of psychotic evil, Prisoners is a deep analysis how such evil can exist in the world and what is needed to fight it.

It seems like Villeneuve is adamant on doing everything Scott did - but better. And where his past films were more or less easy targets, Dune is his first foray in Scott's much more competent and succesful period pieces. It will be interesting to see, how Villeneuve fares, once he reaches comes for Alien. Did he already come for Alien with Arrival and we just didn't make the connection that communication - not flamethrowers - is key to a first contact event?
