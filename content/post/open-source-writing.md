# Publishing on GitHub pages allows the audience to see the writing proces
<!--more-->
Publishing as finalization of something has been a rather new invention - and its days seem to be numbered.

In ancient times information could only pass under difficult cirmcustances. Stories and parables had to be told, songs and plays had to be performed and even books needed to be transcribed to be passed around to a wider audience. Each new iteration gave the author, the performer or the scribe the chance to change past mistakes and add new knowledge. It is difficult to measure how much this privilege has been used, but it has been there nonetheless.

With the printing press parts of this privilege has been curtailed partly. But small editions still made it possible to go back and change the most basic errors. I'd argue permanence of books started to kreep in during the industrialization of publishing and greater circulation. It took photographs, records and film to stop other media from changing telling to telling or performance to performance.

The peak of this permanence may as well have been George Lucas's changing of the original Star Wars trilogy with the special editions. Instead of embracing the artists changes by accepting them and then judging the current state of the movies, fans chose to challenge the concept of the author's right to change anything at all.

Since I publish this blog on GitHub pages I observe an interrelated phenomenon: I draft a post and commit to the repository, but don't publish it right away. When I come back to change and polish it, these changes get committed as well and could be tracked by other people.
