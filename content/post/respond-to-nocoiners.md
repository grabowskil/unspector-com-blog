# Blockchain is under attack by no-coiners and the community seems to be unable to react
<!--more-->
After uncountable rug-pulls and Ponzi-schemes crypto has accumulated kind of a bad rep. On one hand this is not totally unearned, on the other hand the general critiques plaguing twitter at the moment are vastly exaggerated. Still the community seems to be unable to react in any meaningful way and this reveals the true ugly face of crypto: the dominance of depressive shitposters and crypto-tech-bros is hindering the discussion of economic implications of blockchain and the many persistent failures of traditional finance.

Blockchain isn't a scam invented in a vacuum to part people and their money. As a database technology (the "public ledger" part of Blockchain) it isn't even really connected to money. All data, which needs to be public and the reporting parties cannot be trusted, could be stored on-chain. Corporate balance sheets of publicly traded companies, trades of securities and votes in public elections are easy examples, where everyone (including every no-coiner) could profit immensely. And in these instances no measurable harm would be done: Publicly traded companies are already required to disclose this information, stock prices are already public and the outcome of public votes is already known.

The only thing that would change is trust in public information: If every account of a company is a wallet, every expense and income is accounted for. If anything is leaving the wallets undeclared, foul play is to be expected. If numbers don't add up, the numbers are simply wrong and not open to interpretation.<br />
A lot of information about public markets at the moment is third party guessing at best and untrustworthy self reporting at worst. If every trade and price of facilitation is known and can be traced, manipulation is not impossible, but can be identified by the public immediately, without trusting a third party or a gatekeeper.<br />
The outcome of public votes have been questioned in the past and the questioning - justified or not - have become increasingly vocal and sometimes violent. Increasing trust in these outcomes should be a mandatory task for every government at the moment.

A lot of use cases have one critical challenge in common: The dreaded oracle problem. While on-chain data in a robust and diversified validator/miner-environment is always true and consistent, their connection to reality mustn't be. Therefore a trustworthy oracle is needed to reflect the changes in reality on-chain.<br />
Corporate balance sheets include semi-finished and finished products, intellectual property and other non-monetary values, that would need to committed and tracked on chain. Their valuation may be altered in reality (produce goes bad, valuation of properties, tangible or intellectual changes).<br />
Votes cast could be faked and altered **before** being committed to chain.<br />
(On-chain stock exchanges are quite easy and don't suffer from oracle problem as much.)<br />
Solving the oracle problem is hard, maybe impossible even. And this is why a lot of projects are focussing on elaborate scams and blunt rug-pulls. Because it is much easier.

Tech-Bros aren't used to solve hard problems. Silicon Valley culture doesn't foster long-term thinking, but rather "entrepreneurship" - the art of selling something (primarily oneself) and achieving quarterly targets.<br />
This is why the community seems to be unable to react nuanced and measured on blunt critics seeing and calling out scams: Traditional finance isn't free of scamming by individuals or corporations by a long-shot. But it solved concrete and hard problems plaguing humanity for centuries, like transferring and storing value without taking on umproportional risks. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies "solved" at most the same problems, but crypto at large fails to fulfil its promises to imbue things with trust.

Solving the oracle problem is one of the only ways to surpass traditional finance. Instead of offering fluff like JPEGs and shitcoin pump and dumps, future projects should focus on this. Then it will be much easier to respond to no-coiners.
