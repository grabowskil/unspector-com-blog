# consuming unstructured audio information live is time intensive and difficult - so the very best creators are needed
<!--more-->
There are many reasons why clubhouse has been everywhere and why it somehow disappeared again from the public's mind. I am not predicting clubhouse to fail catastrophically, since both Snapchat and TikTok had their respective news- and hypecycles and artificial spotlights and grassroot movements. Clubhouse could get these cycles - often connected to rounds of venture capital investment - as well. But in this coverage downtime I'd like to examine major challenges clubhouse (and each of its inevitable copycat apps by facebook, twitter & co.) has to overcome.

Clubhouse is a combination of two different known and succesful concepts, namely live streaming and podcasting.<br />
Live streaming apps like twitch focus on streaming video games specifically and any audio-visual content in general. Their concept is constructed around one or multiple persons in a "studio-like" environment entertaining their audience unstructured and in real time. Streams are mostly done without a script and often without a defined broadcasting plan concerning length and time.<br />
Podcasting on the other hand can be rather unstructured, though the most succesful podcasts tend to work like radio shows of old: Some form of script or at least a topic, which participants prepared in advance and some loosely defined broadcasting plan.<br />
YouTube's video essays already are some kind of amalgam between these concepts and are at the same time audio-visual content and rather scripted.

Audio based live streaming apps like clubhouse face the broad challenge of being inherently unscripted and therefore need to adapt concepts known from video live streaming. Abstract concepts are more easily explained using visuals and audio lacks this channel. I'm confident that enterprising and creative clubhousers (club members?) could find ways around this challenge just as podcasters have before them.<br />
Clubhouse specifically faces the additional challenge of having an "open mic"-like stage. Therefore participants are unable to prepare the current topic beforehand and speakers need to be exceptionally good at discussing - potentially complex or political - topics off the cuff, while still entertaining the audience.<br />
Therefore clubhouse is cornering itself between a rock and a hard place: It needs the very best clubhousers on stage to be interesting for a broad audience and it makes it difficult for clubhousers on stage to prepare their discussion and convey abstract concepts at the same time.

Obviously there is a great way around this challenge: Pay clubhousers absurd amounts of money to a) attract the very best and b) justify its high barrier to entry for clubhousers. And this is the real challenge:<br />
On the one hand, if a prospective perticipant is talented entertaining a passive live audience, they can make money now creating a twitch-channel (or youtube/facebook live).<br />
On the other hand, If an aspiring clubhouser is good at conveying abstract topics through audio, they have no incentive to do this live and can just create a podcast.

At this time clubhouse has no incentive - besides brand building and maybe narcissism - to attract the most talented speakers. Monetization and revenue sharing with creators is essential to capture a broader market - and getting a larger share of everyones time, since audio based information is difficult to compress (it cannot be skimmed like text) and live content cannot be consumed efficiently (it cannot be played faster like podcasts).

I am very curious to follow clubhouse's development and how it will transform to meet these challenges.
