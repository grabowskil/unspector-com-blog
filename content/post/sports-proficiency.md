# When sports becomes more professionalized, it gets more boring to watch ... until it gets better again!
<!--more-->
Early last year I read the book "Range" by David Epstein and was fairly surprised by a lot of ideas.
I personally consider myself a generalist, who beleives to know a little of everything, which combine becomes a lot. Though, Epstein writes, this is not only one of many strategies, but a winning strategy - even in sports. This triggered tow things. First: My confirmation bias, obviously. And second: my journey into a new lens, through which I was examining the sports I watched and enjoyed.<br />
What is considered as "sports" varies greatly but more often than not consists of some - fairly arbitrary - rules to grade an athletic or coordinatory task. This seems rather reductive and only includes chess and similar organized thinking-based sports at a tangent, but bear with me here.

Recruiting and organized training for a sport defines its proficiency level. Low proficiency sports recruit from people of a homogenous population (one town, one country, one gender, etc.). Sports of higher proficiency can start to recruit more regional agnostic, since people will choose to travel or move for a limited time to compete in this sport. Sports of the highest proficiency will become global influences and can recruit contestants from all around the globe.<br />
I believe sports of the highest professional level will correlate with one or more traits:
* fun (obviously)
* monetary incentive
* easy access, either through simplicity or by a robust network of (state) sponsored organization

Consider an infinite pool of people, which are all more or less the same (aka "the population of the earth"). You want to pick grade people from this pool, who are exceptionally good at flinging an average sized banana high into the air and you will grade them on the achieved height by some arbitrary rules, for example: If they hit a small window at close to 100 meters. Everything far above or below nets no points, but everything close to that point nets the most points. You call this sport banana flinging (what else?) and want to get together a tiered league of around 200 people, who will compete in your sport. How would you do it?

At first you can only recruit contestants in your immidiate vincinity. Nobody from a far away country will move, just to compete in your obscure banana flinging. Therefore your pool of people is not really infinite and consists of people you know and who trust you enough to help with your little banana flinging thing. Chances are this pool of people is normally distributed around your socio-economic background. As you and your friends convice more people (still fairly close to your own socio-economic background) to join in on the fun, banana flinging reaches the first of multiple proficiency levels and becomes somewhat organized around a homogenous population.<br />
If this regional competition gets traction, gets traction it may draw in people from farther away, but nothing inidcates, this will change the homogeneity of the pool. Still the broader regional approach, will get banana flinging closer to a more diverse contestant pool and special traits outside the control of the sport become more relevant. People who played baseball or american football semi-professionally may have a greater chance of throwing an object like a banana into a specific height window and may join the pool  at a more regular interval. At the same time the pool may get chosen by baseball and american football scouts to poach the best banana flingers away.<br />
When no monetary incentive is presented at this proficiency level it may become quite difficult to maintain a pool of "good" players, therefore every sports needs criteria which don't appeal to any other sports, to stop poaching (throwing objects is interesting for a lot of established sports, so this is difficult for banana flinging) or needs to include a career opportunities, other sports can't provide.<br />
Maybe an banana flinging super fan is rich and will sponsor price money for tournaments on a regular basis, which exceeds rookie contracts in lower levels of other sports, so good players aren't poached as easily. In our modern society a lot of fans can get together and provide an incentive for advertising partners to participate, simply because they refuse to watch anything else, when this tournaments happen and advertisers couldn't reach them in this environment. This is forming a virtual rich super fan with a few extra steps.<br />
With financial backing secured, banana flinging can reach the next proficiency level and - given enough interest - become a global phenomenon. But contestants form far away countries may need to provide for their own expenses moving towards the banana flinging hotspots, therefore you are recruiting "globally", but still not from a really diverse pool, since foreign contestants need to have the monetary backing to compete.<br />
To reach the last level of banana flinging as a mass sports you need to lower the barrier of entry. Olympic sports have reached this level per definition, as well as a few sports like football or american football and to some degree other sports catering to a big domestic market.<br />
Well funded banana flinging regional leagues will scout in their vincinity and feed your global league and banana flinging events need to draw large crowds and big advertisers, getting on international tv and creating pull effects for state sponsored prgrammes to recruit and scout the less well-off.

Sports, which reached the highest levels of proficiency will see themselves confronted with a few challenges. In the early stages of their existence a lot of appeal comes from becoming more diverse and bringing in different socio-economic or regional influences. A new method of throwing bananas might prove more useful than traditional methods and the more people with more backgrounds get into the sport, the more methods get tried - and given the chance to succeed or fail.<br />
But when one method proves far superior it gets adapted by more players, nullifying its appeal again. With scouting and recuriting adapting to these new methods the pool gets more homogenous again. In the end a few little - maybe even not influentiable traits like genetics - decide about the outcome of a game.<br />
