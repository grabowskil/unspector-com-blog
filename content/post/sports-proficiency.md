# When sports becomes more professionalized, it gets more boring to watch ... until it gets better again!
<!--more-->
Early last year I read the book "Range" by David Epstein and was fairly surprised by a lot of ideas.
I personally consider myself a generalist, who beleives to know a little of everything, which combine becomes a lot. Though, Epstein writes, this is not only one of many strategies, but a winning strategy - even in sports. This triggered tow things. First: My confirmation bias, obviously. And second: my journey into a new lens, through which I was examining the sports I watched and enjoyed.<br />
What is considered as "sports" varies greatly but more often than not consists of some - fairly arbitrary - rules to grade an athletic or coordinatory task. This seems rather reductive and only includes chess and similar organized thinking-based sports at a tangent, but bear with me here.

Recruiting and organized training for a sport defines its proficiency level. Low proficiency sports recruit from people of a homogenous population (one town, one country, one gender, one socio-economice background, etc.). Sports of higher proficiency can start to recruit more regionally agnostic, since people will choose to travel or move for a limited time to compete in this sport. Sports of the highest proficiency will become a global phenomenon and can recruit contestants from all around the globe.<br />
I believe sports of the highest professional level will correlate with one or more traits:
* fun (obviously)
* monetary incentive
* easy access, either through simplicity or by a robust network of (state) sponsored organization

These criteria can easily explain sports like football and athletics, which - on the lowest level - don't need a lot of equipment or specialized places to just play for fun. It gets trickier with sports like american football (which needs more and at the same time more expensive equipment) and tennis.
On the other hand
