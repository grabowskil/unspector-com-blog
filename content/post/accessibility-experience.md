# A battle is fought in video games, which informs UX- and UI-design at large
<!--more-->
Video games have been historically rather inaccessible: to play many video games a custom input device or a custom way of using an existing device had to be learned and understood. In the past decade or two a lot of input design has been harmonised in games of comparable genres, still: a general knowledge of a controller and WASD-style of keyboard and mouse input is not enough to play every game immediately, even, if a lot of movements seem to be standardised by now.

This inaccessibility is partially what has made video games popular to begin with: everybody had to learn the controls and get good with them to compete, whoever was unwilling to immerse themselves into controls, was unable to participate in the first place, which helped forming a tribe around the general skill to use the input method.

The tribalism surrounding this initial road block of learning the controls may have existed since Pong, but comes to light every few years, when FromSoftware releases a new Souls game. These games are notoriously difficult compared to other games at the time of their respective release and so is their newest title Elden Ring.<br />
At the same time we live in an era of unprecedented accessibility options in games: A lot of major game publishers and first-party console manufacturers are recognising people with physical disabilities as a market for custom controllers and offer software options to completely remap the control scheme.

There seem to be two approaches in video game design, catering to different audiences: Total scalable accessibility giving nearly everyone the opportunity to experience the content of a game and purposefully challenging games making it difficult for less skilled and more important disabled people to experience the whole game.

Those different approaches aren't new in media at large: People unable to read are barred from written knowledge as well as blind people. Deaf people are barred from audio-content as well as people unable to understand the spoken language.<br />
There are fixes for both written language as well as recorded language and movies and tv shows can use closed captions and descriptive audio tracks or picture-in-picture sign language interpreters to bridge all these inaccessibilities.

Video games have no easy fix for their inherent inaccessibility: A player needs to hear, see and interact with an input device to consume all of the game.<br />
Every fix a developer implements to bridge one or more of these inaccessibilities marks which part of the they are deeming relevant for the experience and which parts are just in the way.<br />
There is a different way to make the difference clear: a book and an audio play, based upon the same book aren't the same experience. Offering the book as a substitute for people unable to hear the play is not the same as making the play possible to "feel" for hearing impaired listeners. The same goes for a movie as a substitute for dyslexic people. The content and the relevant information in it may be close enough aligned, but the experience is utterly different.

These design decisions don't concern only video games: It is negligent to produce important information you'd like as many people as possible to see only as text
