# You should always contribute.
<!--more-->
Contributing seems hard. "What if they don't like my idea?", "What if my idea is useless?", "What if I didn't understand the problem and my idea is off topic?", are all the same basic thinking: ideas can be valuable or valueless - and valueless ideas aren't worth contributing, or worse need to be scolded at.

A lot of this thinking is embedded in our educational system: When time is of the essence not every idea has the same possibility of getting put into action. When the topic is complex and there is only a limited amount of time not every idea can be discussed in depth. Every lesson or seminar is time boxed, therefore a lot of ideas won't fit. Therefore we learn: there are unfit ideas.

This thinking leads to a homogenized idea landscape: Every idea someone has is subconciously compared to the available time box. This is the only way to finish "in time". But this can only lead to the homogenized (read: low) quality we all have come to expect.

When you do a project and you get a definitive budget and/or have a concrete deadline, every non-homgenized idea has to be discarded by default. Nobody will be happy with the outcome but the triangle "quality, time and budget", cannot be changed, no matter how hard you try.

When you try to create a product and want to take the highest possible price, you will need to create the highest possible value. Therefore every idea counts. This will be expensive and might take a long time, but the quality will be much higher. To create a great product we have to unlearn what has been embedded in our educational system for decades: there are no unfit ideas.

A lot of products created aren't the slightest bit delighting and often times even disappointing.<br />
If you try to capture this market be bland, be cost and time efficient and only expect to take the lowest price possible. Be aware that one cannot win this race to the bottom, but can only participate for a limited amount of time, until a cheaper competitor comes around. You should be long gone by then. If you don't contribute in this environment, it is because you accept every outcome available, you are standing down and don't really care about anything except time and budget.

If you try to capture the "other" market, where products are delighting and inspiring and you aren't contributing, than you are hiding.

Standing down can be expected, hiding is not. Know the difference.
