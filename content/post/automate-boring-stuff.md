# What is boring stuff? And why does it need to be automated?
<!--more-->
You read this saying many times: automate the boring stuff. Probably you had an immidiate though in mind, what this boring stuff that needed automation was: doing the dishes or updating your software (apt update && apt upgrade, anyone?) or creating that Excel report for that meeting, maybe.<br />
But the more you think about it: What constitutes as boring stuff worhty of automation? Is this a task that doesn't really need to be done at all? A task that needs to be done, though not by a human, since it doesn't need "thinking" oversight? Or a task, which is sometimes complex, but most of the time isn't and therefore bores the ones doing it until it doesn't?

Automate building your site with webpack, sure, but maybe don't deploy critical systems without any oversight whatsoever (automate the oversight, maybe?). Create one-off Excel reports by hand, since - Excel be damned - you might find some interesting information nugget you didn't expect to find, but automate regular reports. Stop sending status updates nobody reads, instead of automating them.

Just because something bores you it doesn't mean it is worthy of getting automated. And just because it bores you most of the time it doesn't mean it is a good idea of automating it.
