# Are you trying to influence the efficient market or the irrational participants?
<!--more-->
Every negotiation is taking place in a market. Every market is efficient in the long run. If a negotiation isn't going your way, you need to ask yourself: Do you try to influence the efficiency of the market, or are you trying to influence its irrational participants?

When you try to settle a negotiation by influencing the market and you are not succeeding fast, you probably won't succeed at all, since the market will be efficient given enough time. Though influencing the participants is absolutely possible - even in the long run.

We don't often have the chance to influence the market. We'd need to find a loophole or be the sole provider of a good to have some inlfuencing control over the market. But sometimes we are put into a position where we are able to give the illusion of controlling the market.
