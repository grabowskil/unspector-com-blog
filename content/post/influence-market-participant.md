# Are you trying to influence the efficient market or the participants?
<!--more-->
Every negotiation is taking place in a market. Every market is efficient in the long run. If a negotiation isn't going your way, you need to ask yourself: Are you trying to influence the efficiency of the market, or are you trying to influence its irrational participants?

When you try to raise prices without delivering corresponding value hoping your competitors will do the same, you are trying to influence the market. When everybody moves upmarket, they create a vacuum downmarket, no old competitor can quickly compete in.<br />
When you try to lower prices without adequately cutting costs or gaining efficiency hoping your competitors cannot do the same, you are trying to influence the market. When everybody races to the bottom, they create a vacuum upmarket, no old competitor can quickly move up to again.

We may find a loophole or think we are the sole provider of a good or service, which both can grant us some influencing control over our market. But this control is an illusion: If we abuse this power we create a need for another, a better competitor.<br />
Inversely our customer may find a loophole or think there is always a cheaper competitor, which both can grant them some influencing control over our market. But this control is an illusion: If they abuse this power they create a need in the future, when there are less and less competitors working in this market.<br />
Illusion of market control cannot be sustained forever, therefore manipulators tend to create the feeling of immidiacy - and by doing this they implicitly accept what we already know: We cannot really influence the efficient market, we can only delay its irrational participants recognizing market control is an illusion.

If the deal is too good to be true, it probably is and you will find out - later.<br />
If a customer wants a lower price and you are not sure how to meet this price, it will be a rude awakening for both of you - later.<br />
The only difference you can make in these situations is choosing not to trade.

Give your customer a good feeling, be helpful, and create the value they need - then they will grant you the arbitrage you need. Adding value justifies higher prices, removing value justifies lower prices. Given enough time the market ensures both statements becoming true.
