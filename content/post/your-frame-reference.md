# The value of personal experience is a double edged sword
<!--more-->
When one experiences something it gets added to their personal frame of reference. Did a brand deliver on their promises? Did a company treat their employees right? Was a person dependable in the past?

All of these experiences form a frame of reference: Did one brand deliver more on their promises than another? Did one company treat their employees better than another? Was one person more dependable than another?

This creates easy heuristics to choose between two similar choices. Also this sets a dangerous precedent to settle for a low floor: What if a lot brands you ever interacted with fails to deliver on their promise in one way or another? What if a lot of companies you worked at treats their employees unfairly in their own way? What if a lot of persons you met is unreliable in different ways?

Your frame of reference could simply be wrong: "This is better than that.", can be an easy heuristic to decide fast, though it can also mean: "This is less bad than that."

Before using the frame of reference heuristic, think: What would be the ideal solution? How would a brand, a company, or a person need to act? When the decision is hard, maybe decide against this ideal, instead of your possibly skewed frame of reference.
