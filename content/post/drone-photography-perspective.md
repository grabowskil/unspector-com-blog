# Drone photography is a total change in cultural perspective
<!--more-->
Photography is around for a mere 200 years. Our current iteration of hand-held 35mm photography (and their digitalized version) maybe 100 years. Which is considerably shorter than other fine arts.

A photograph has three basic characteristics:
* Documentational quality: What the picture shows is a moment frozen in time. Therefore it documents a moment, which is already in the past. Hitherto a viewer can judge if the moment had been capture-worthy in their own right.
* Technical quality: Taking a picture cannot be done with everyday items (like sculpting or painting for example). Therefore a viewer can judge if the photographer succeeds in controlling their equipment and dialing the camera in. Additionally - as with painting - there exist a lot of techniques or rules compositing subjects or colors which can be adhered to - or intentionally broken.
* Artistic/novelty quality: Every art is expressive and tries to seek novel ways to represent the artist.

A war photographer may take pictures with exceptional documentational qualities.<br />
Many phtographers in the street photography style of the last few decades are knowledgeable with their gear and take pictures of exceptional technical quality.<br />
Art schools, galleries and teenagers instagram feeds are choke full of artistic expressions using photography.

But all of these pictures are inherently two-dimensional, taken from the view point of an ant.

Drone photography is here to change that and democratize aerial view points. Where one needed to climb a high mountain to photograph a valley or needed to pay high sums for a helicopter ride, drones are cheap, easy to use and position independet.

I think drones could be the beginning of a change not unlike color-film: Taking photographs and making films was possible before the rise of color-film. But it has been a dramatic change how we perceive our environment nonetheless. Viewing beautiful nature or influences of pollution or even our own home from above gives us a new, three dimensional perspective.
