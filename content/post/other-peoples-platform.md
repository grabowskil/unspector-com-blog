# Is your content valuable enough to live on your own platform? Is another platform good enough to value your content?
<!--more-->
Nearly everyone in the world has the ability to put content on the internet. Be it a TikTok clip, a blog post, or an app in the various app stores.<br />
On the one hand exchanging and presenting content seems to be completely democratized at first glance.<br />
On the other hand exists widening gap to put content on the internet without the help of a big platform.

When you post an informative video on YouTube, which millions of people want to see, Google feeds first. When you publish an app on the AppStore, Apple feeds first. Publishing content on facebook is a pennyless effort in and of itself. And creating your own website is rather expensive compared to ad based platforms.

If you want to demonstrate the value of your content, you need to show you think your content has value. Other people consuming your content may notice if you yourself thought your content valuable enough to host it on your own space and money.<br />
Though you won't reach as many people in a short period of time and it will take longer for your content to get discovered (if it gets discovered at all).

Be opportunistic: Host a space for your content yourself and demonstrate its value, but also use other people's platform to promote your content. You don't owe platforms your content and they don't owe you to feed first.
