# But every challenge is a hardware challenge first
<!--more-->
When we look at cutting edge software we must note, that it cannot run well on mediocre hardware. This has been somewhat offset by using the nearly infinite performance supplied by cloud computing, though the limit is still visible with applications like blockchain mining, gaming and physics simulation (which all tend to use the same hardware ressources).

We have been inclined to believe software solutions are available first and hardware performance "just follows". And with Moore's Law and processing power this has been true for the last few decades: The most memorable example has been Crysis in 2007, which couldn't run exceptionally well on any PC you could buy, but ran okay on my laptop in 2011 and on a decent machine in 2021 the fans aren't even spinning up playing it, because we have so much excess capacity in our most basic machines.
