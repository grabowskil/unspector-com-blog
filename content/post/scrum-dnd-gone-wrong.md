# Even though the rule book is beefy and the Dungeon Master is skilled: D&D cannot really reproduce reality - and neither can Scrum
<!--more-->
Whoever played a good session of Dungeons & Dragons or other similar table top RPGs can tell you: It can feel really close to a real life experience. You may not have left your room but you definitely experienced an adventure.<br />
Sure, the barrier to entry was high: You had to learn the complicated and overbearing combat rules and some goblin encounters overstayed their welcome. But when your group of adventurers succeeded you felt overjoyed - most of the time thanks to your Dungeon Master, who balanced these pesky goblin encounters on the fly and nudged your group in the right direction, when you were too dense to identify the right path towards the dragon.<br />
If your DM did their job completely right, you only experienced this joy and didn't even notice the balancing or the nudging!

Whoever played a good session of D&D and also experienced a working scrum environment can tell you: Both things are similar - to a fault.<br />
Where D&D has a thick rule book consisting of nearly equal parts completely overdeveloped and totally undercooked rulesets for "every situation imaginable", scrum provides the scrum guide - equal parts hyper-specific rules how things should be done down to the minute and broad guidelines providing no immidiate use at all.<br />
Where D&D has a lot of "accompanying reading" to help aspiring DMs to manage difficult situations, scrum has spun off a - often times dubious - consultancy industry to help organizations who dare to implement scrum.<br />
Where D&D has its Dungeon **Master** to guide the adventurers to fame and fortune, scrum doesn't even try to hide the similarities (intentional or not) and provides the Scrum **Master**, who is responsible for guiding and helping the team achieve their goals.

And this is, where the "similar, **to a fault**"-part sets in: D&D's DM has the power to alter the fabric of the (imagined) universe to solve complex situations, scrum's SM has not. Sure scrum has its methods to make the SM's task easier and giving the illusion of altering the fabric of the (real) universe (splitting user stories on the basis of their sum of story points and not professional necessity for example), but these methods can only help stalling overly complex problems until a future date.<br />
Every complex situation that can arise during a D&D session probably arose in another session in the past, which legitimizes its accompanying literatur. Is "throwing a chicken" a simple strength check or requires the chicken-shape and chicken-behavior a dexterity check? Since there is no inherently right answer a DM might choose to ask the community or consult accompanying literature and choose whichever solution feels right. A SM may not have that luxury of being omnipotent and unquestionable and their decisions or guidings can cost the organisation valuable ressources.<br />
Scrum excuses itself from criticisms like this by conceding "every organisation can adapt scrum to their liking" and "not every project is suited for scrum", before shouting "your organisation needs to commit to it completely or don't do it at all" - which are all totally normal and mature reactions to mild criticisms and not reminiscing to a cult at all.

Organisations, which work with scrum for a long period of time find ways around these challenges (they are not insurmountable), but in the end scrum stumbles over the same problems as D&D: It chooses to be a holistic framework for explaining **and** managing the whole of reality, though reality is more complex than even the thickest book could describe. For D&D this is part of the fun and challenging the DM with difficult situations can elevate the memorability and enjoyability of the session for all players. For scrum this is an unsolved problem and a material risk for every organisation implementing it.
