# A watch is complicated, humans are complex
<!--more-->
Though we use complicated and complex more or less synonymous in our day to day lives to describe difficult systems, confounding these terms can have dire consequences.

Complicated can be traced back to the latin "complicare", which means "to fold", while complex descends from the latin "complexus" (which literally translates to complex while other translations bend the meaning towards "encircling" or "surrounding").<br />
When something is folded, it can be unfolded by reversing every step that was used to fold it. Therefore complicated describes things, systems and objects which may not be understood on first sight, but can be understood by reversing their construction (their "folding"). A mechanical watch is rather complicated, though a watchmaker (or any relevantly interested and patient person) is able to reverse its complicatedness and make its function obvious. A lot of computers and programs are "watch-like" in that sense: Just because they can't always be grasped at first sight, a programmer (or any relevantly interested and patient person) can understand them eventually. After understanding them every output can be predicted by knowing their inputs. If a prediction about an output in a complicated system doesn't become true, not every input was known.<br />
When something is complex it - like complicated things - cannot be understood on first sight. Therefore it is natural to assume it could be understood eventually through reversing. And this reveals the dangerous logical fallacy: While complicated things can be reversed ("unfolded"), complex systems just have many influences "encircling" and "surrounding" them at the same time. These influences can be identified and maybe understood in retrospect, though there will always be risk associated with their outputs, even when knowing all of the inputs.

In our data-driven society, which will become more data-driven every minute, this difference is crucial. While it is possible to make stable predictions about complicated systems - enough data and understanding required; the same is not possible for complex systems, no matter how often some company beats you over the head with the accuracy of their algorithm.<br />
Therefore we should always ask ourselves: Am I predicting the outcome of a complicated or a complex system - full well knowing, that we cannot differentiate the two on first glance.
