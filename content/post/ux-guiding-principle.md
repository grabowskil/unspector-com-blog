# Has it really worked, if the user didn't see it?
<!--more-->
When creating a website or an application (or something in between) there seem to be two challenges:
1. Making it work.
2. Making it look good.

The first challenge seems insurmountable often times, therefore we tend to think it has to be solved first.<br />
Though, after we thought hard about the problem and explored possible solutions we - more often than not - find a way to solve it. After it has been solved, the "hard" part is done. Or ist it?

Just because we know something works, it doesn't mean anyone else will believe us. To convince everyone that our product works, it needs to look like it is working. And this means the second challenge is much harder and much more important.

If you take on a project, because you think you can solve the first challenge, solve the second challenge first. Make it look like it works and then make it work.
