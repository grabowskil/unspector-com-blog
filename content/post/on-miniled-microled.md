# 12.9 M1 iPad Pro shows mini LED will be the immidiate future, but what about blooming?
<!--more-->
Displaytechnology only moves in a straight line in one direction and everything else gets left behind. LG would like this direction to be OLED. But low light dissipation makes OLED the lesser choice in a lot of living rooms. Additionally OLEDs do degrade over time and burn-in is a remaining risk. All of these shortcomings make OLED more of a direct successor to plasma. An enthusiast choice, for the aficionados who create their home around their television - and not the other way around.<br />
Local dimming LEDs with a polarization layer to filter out smudged grays for blacks do reach comparable picture quality to OLEDs in scatter light environments, which cannot be darkened (for example: city apartment living rooms without outside blinds). Since most local dimmed LEDs doesn't have a dimming zone to pixel ratio of 1:1 hard edges of brightly lit objects moving directly above dark or even black zones tend to "bleed" into their surroundings.<br />
Mini LED is more or less a fancy term for a local dimming LED display with a lot of dimming zones. In theory mini LED should reach even more OLED-like light dissipation and mitigate bleeding. But first reviews of the 2021 12.9 M1 iPad Pro shows this theory to be false. As for examplte [the Verge reports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxDDBOKDpb0) bleeding or blooming gets even worse in contrasty white-on-black situations with a mini LED display. This is probably due to denser luminous energy, which is led through less pixels. Therefore pixels directly next to each other get more excited, while pixels in close vincinity stay dark.<br />
This disproves the theory that a close-to-but-not-quite 1:1 ratio of dimming zones to pixels is inherently better than a larger ratio and there seems to be an "optimal" ratio for contrasty white-on-black situations, which is larger than "mini LED".  

Mini LED - just like QLED before - isn't able to marry OLED-like contrast with strong light dissipation and is just a marketing term for "a lot of dimming zones". I believe until micro LED (an inherently display technology) is upon us, we reached the best display quality with backlit LCD-displays.
