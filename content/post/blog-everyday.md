# Doing something everyday is tedious and can be exhausting. It is useful and fulfilling nonetheless.
<!--more-->
When we are encouraged - or forced - to do something everyday, each day, we know what's up. Something needs to be automated. But as I [examinated before]({< ref "/post/automate-boring-stuff" >}), not everything is worthy to be automated and not everything can be automated. Still tasks, which need to be done everyday have a hard time being valued - especially in IT, where automation is deemed possible.

This makes it hard for habits and rituals to form: If you have to do a task everyday you can think about automating it. If you want to do a ritual everyday or form a habit automation is inherently out of the question.

Laziness in the face of tasks is the only way to do the tasks better. Laziness in the face of rituals is unhealthy.

If you need to create the same Excel report everyday, it should be imperative to try and automate the report to do more valuable stuff. When you want to form the habit of meditation or running or cooking instead of ordering take-out, there is no shortcut and trying to automate or streamline the process defeats its purpose.

Automating the boring stuff is showing up and doing the work. Being lazy with your own goals is hiding. Know the difference.
