# It seems preposterous to assume, though everyone's frame of reference could be wrong.
<!--more-->
In ancient times, humans couldn't have the same frame of reference humans have now: Is writing on papyrus easier and more comfortable than writing on a laptop? Is pulling heavy loads by hand or by electric crane easier? Is sleeping in a bed more restful, than sleeping on the floor?<br />
We can answer these questions based on our frame of reference (though I have never written on papyrus, maybe it is great).

In the middle ages, there could have been a frame of reference for some people: "Is believing in a flat earth more useful than believing in a globe?", is a question some (few) people could have answered during the middle ages, as well as: "Is living without any sanitation healthier than living with roman canalization?"

If we live in a time like the middle ages, we can work with our collective frame of reference and our heuristic based decisions won't be skewed by much.<br />
If we live in a time like ancient, we cannot assume our collective frame of reference and our heuristic based decisions are right.
